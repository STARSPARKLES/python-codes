Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup:
The script Code 1 demonstrates web scraping using Python's urllib and BeautifulSoup libraries. It fetches content from a specified URL (https://www.codewithharry.com), parses the HTML using BeautifulSoup, and extracts all anchor tags (<a>). Each link is categorized as an onsite or offsite link based on its URL prefix.

Token Classification with Regular Expressions:
The Token Classifier script utilizes regular expressions (re) to classify tokens within user-input Python code. It identifies and categorizes variables, numerical values (NUMPOT), string literals (ALPHAPOT), special characters, operators, and keywords (KEYWORDS). Users can input Python code, and the script outputs the classification and count of each token category found.
